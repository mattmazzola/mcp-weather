# MCP Client

https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-client

## Usage

Simply run the client - it will automatically connect to the weather MCP server:

```sh
uv run client.py
```

The client will start the MCP weather server and allow you to ask natural language questions about weather, such as:
- "What are the weather alerts in California?"
- "What's the forecast for Seattle, WA?"
